# Udacity Robotics Nanodegree
## Where Am I?

Simultaneous localization and Mapping project for the Robotics Nanodegree Program.

## The database

The sample database generated by mapping the environment is available at this link

* [Database](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-4O7Lc6X76wU5D4H1QVjyAR3OAErzdI1/view?usp=sharing)

## How to run

First launch the world with the robot.

```
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch my_robot world.launch
```

Second launch the mapping runtime.

```
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch my_robot mapping.launch
```

Then you can launch the control interface for the robot using the teleop package

```
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
```

## How to view the mapping database

The mapping database is generated inside the .ros folder on the home path

```
rtabmap-databaseViewer ~/.ros/rtabmap.db
```

if you want to run the sample database download it on any path and run

```
rtabmap-databaseViewer <download-path>/rtabmap.db
```
